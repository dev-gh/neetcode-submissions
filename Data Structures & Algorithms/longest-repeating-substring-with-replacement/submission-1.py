'''
You are given a string s consisting of only uppercase english characters and an integer k. You can choose up to k characters of the string and replace them with any other uppercase English character.

After performing at most k replacements, return the length of the longest substring which contains only one distinct character.

Example 1:

Input: s = "XYYX", k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation: Either replace the 'X's with 'Y's, or replace the 'Y's with 'X's.

Example 2:

Input: s = "AAABABB", k = 1

Output: 5

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 1000
    0 <= k <= s.length

class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        frequencies = defaultdict(int)
        left = 0
        result = 0
        for right in range(len(s)):
            frequencies[s[right]] += 1
            window_length = sum(frequencies.values())

            if window_length - max(frequencies.values()) > k:
                frequencies[s[left]] -= 1
                window_length -= 1
                left += 1

            result = max(window_length, result)
        
        return result
