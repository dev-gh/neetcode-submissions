'''
You are given an integer array heights where heights[i] represents the height of the ithith bar.

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,7,2,5,4,7,3,6]

Output: 36

Example 2:

Input: height = [2,2,2]

Output: 4

Constraints:

    2 <= height.length <= 1000
    0 <= height[i] <= 1000
